# WithWebComponentsKnobs

Base on the data in custom-elements.json we can automatically generate knobs for your stories.

To enable this feature you will need to add an additional decorator.

**MDX**

```md
import { withKnobs, withWebComponentsKnobs } from '@open-wc/demoing-storybook';

<Meta
  title="WithWebComponentsKnobs|Docs"
  decorators={[withKnobs, withWebComponentsKnobs]}
  parameters={{ component: 'demo-wc-card', options: { selectedPanel: 'storybookjs/knobs/panel' } }}
/>

<Story name="Custom Header" height="220px">
  {html`
    <demo-wc-card header="Harry Potter">A character that is part of a book series...</demo-wc-card>
  `}
</Story>
```

**CSF**

```js
import { html } from 'lit-html';
import { withKnobs, withWebComponentsKnobs } from '@open-wc/demoing-storybook';

import '../demo-wc-card.js';

export default {
  title: 'Card|Playground',
  component: 'demo-wc-card',
  decorators: [withKnobs, withWebComponentsKnobs],
  parameters: { options: { selectedPanel: 'storybookjs/knobs/panel' } },
};

export const singleComponent = () => html`
  <demo-wc-card></demo-wc-card>
`;
```

## Example output

Don't forget to switch to Canvas if you wanna see the knobs.

<Story name="Example output" height="220px">
  {html`
    <demo-wc-card header="Harry Potter">
      A character that is part of a book series...
    </demo-wc-card>
  `}
</Story>

## Provide own light dom

By adding knobs within the template you can provide additional knobs for this content.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Provide own light dom" height="220px">
    {html`
      <demo-wc-card>
        <p>${text('Content', 'Some text', 'Properties')}</p>
      </demo-wc-card>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Knobs for current component

By default it will show knobs for all elements of the current "component".

You can set the component for the whole file via

```js
<Meta parameters={{ component: 'demo-wc-card' }} />
```

or per story

```js
<Story name="Card" parameters={{ component: 'demo-wc-card' }}>
```

That means even if you have multiple components in your dom you will have knobs for all of them.

<Story name="Knobs for current Component" height="220px">
  {html`
    <demo-wc-card header="Harry Potter">The main character</demo-wc-card>
    <demo-wc-card header="Lord Voldemort">An evil wizard</demo-wc-card>
  `}
</Story>

That means however that it will only shown knobs for the same elements.

## Provide own querySelectorAll

If you have different elements or want to show knobs for a specific element you can provide your own querySelectorAll.

The parameter is `parameters.customElements.querySelectorAll`.

```js
<Story
  name="My story"
  parameters={{ customElements: { querySelectorAll: 'demo-wc-card:nth-of-type(1)' } }}
>
```

<Story
  name="Provide own querySelectorAll"
  height="220px"
  parameters={{ customElements: { querySelectorAll: 'demo-wc-card:nth-of-type(1)' } }}
>
  {html`
    <demo-wc-card header="Harry Potter">The main character</demo-wc-card>
    <demo-wc-card header="Lord Voldemort">An evil wizard</demo-wc-card>
  `}
</Story>

This is a full querySelectorAll string so here are some examples of what it will look like

- `demo-wc-card:nth-of-type(1)` will only show knobs for the first element
- `demo-wc-card:nth-of-type(2)` will only show knobs for the second element
- `*` will add knobs for all known\* custom elements
- `.content *` will add knobs to all known\* custom elements within the `.content` element
- `div` will throw as no valid custom element can be selected

\* listed in `custom-elements.json`

## State gets reflected back to knobs

When the state of your web component changes then the knobs get updated automatically.
It does this by listening to the following event

- `click`
- `focusin`
- `focusout`
- `keyup`

Additionally it will listen to every event defined in the `custom-elements.json` for this particular element.
For your own events the name does not matter as long as an event gets fired when the state changes it will be picked up.

Whenever a registered event fires all properties are read from the element and synced to the knobs.

This can be very handy when you need to see specific states of elements.

## Debugging helper

Focus for example is quite annoying to debug as when you want to look it up in the Developer Tools the focus already changed.
With displaying the state in the knobs you can see the value while interacting with your component.

However this brings us to another "problem". By default each components properties and css gets it's own tab within the knobs.
Which can be hindering when you want to see how state changes when tabbing through inputs for example.

So you can filter which properties you wanna show and these states for all elements will then be displayed on one page.

The parameter is `parameters.customElements.filterProperties`.

```js
<Story
  name="My story"
  parameters={{ customElements: { filterProperties: ['focused'] } }}
>
```

<Story
  name="Debugging helper"
  height="220px"
  parameters={{
    customElements: { filterProperties: ['focused'], querySelectorAll: 'fake-input' },
  }}
>
  {html`
    First Name:
    <fake-input></fake-input><br />
    Last Name:
    <fake-input></fake-input><br />
    Age:
    <fake-input></fake-input><br />
  `}
</Story>
