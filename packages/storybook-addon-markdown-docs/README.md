# Storybook Addon: Markdown Docs

[//]: # 'AUTO INSERT HEADER PREPUBLISH'

This extension for [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) enables you to use [Markdown JavaScript (mdjs) Format](https://open-wc.org/mdjs/).

## Installation

Please check out [@open-wc/demoing-storybook](https://open-wc.org/demoing/) for a fully integrated setup.

## How it works

This extension converts the mdjs output directly to JavaScript (in CSF format) which can be displayed by storybook docs.
