## Scripts

- `start` runs your app, with a minimal express server directly from source (only works in modern browsers)
- `start:dev` runs your app with auto reload for development, it only works on browsers which support modules for faster builds
- `start:dev:es5` runs your app for development, it only works on browsers that don't support modules (IE11)
- `build` builds your app for production and outputs it in the /dist folder
- `start:build` runs your built app using a plain web server, to prove it works without magic ðŸ˜ƒ
- `build:stats` creates an analysis report of your app bundle to be consumed by Webpack Visualizer and Analyser
- `test` runs your test suite with Karma
- `lint` runs the linter for your project
