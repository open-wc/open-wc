# Web Component Based Design Systems

The hardest part of any project is often overcoming that first blank file and getting content onto that first blank page. Much of the recommendations shared herein are meant to help overcome that in ways that also support you in developing/maintaining your own web components at the highest level. While following those recommendations will go a long way to filling in those blanks, you'll still be left to construct your own functionality once you've applied them all. To support you in taking on this step as well, we've collected a list of web component based design systems from which you can acquire elements or techniques with which to build your own functionality.
