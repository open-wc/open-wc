## Types are good

> The following information is a quote from [Type Safe JavaScript with JSDoc](https://medium.com/@trukrs/type-safe-javascript-with-jsdoc-7a2a63209b76)

Types provide valuable information about the nature of code, and help identify typos, enable refactoring, etc. Most editors these days provide some kind of IntelliSense based on type information gleaned from the code. My favorite is Visual Studio Code. With proper type information it can give you symbol defintions on hover, code completion, symbol renaming across files, etc.

### Benefits of Types

1. Early detection of type errors
2. Better code analysis
3. Improved IDE support
4. Promotes dependable refactoring
5. Improves code readability
6. Provides useful IntelliSense while coding
7. These benefits are provided by using TypeScript, Flow and even JSDoc comments.

### Why types?

Types can help improve your developer experience by giving you:

- Awesome intellisense for @open-wc tools/helpers
- Ability to jump directly to the source of @open-wc code via F12 (in vs code)
