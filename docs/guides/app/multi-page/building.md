Single page apps are great for a snappy user experience when you have highly dynamic content, but a lot of content on the web does not fall into this category. It still makes sense to build websites or apps consisting of multiple pages. This also requires a different approach to your build system.

We are still in the process of investigating and documenting our recommendations for this. In the meantime both [building-rollup](/building/building-rollup.html) and [@open-wc/rollup-plugin-html](https://open-wc.org/building/rollup-plugin-html.html) have tips for these types of projects.
