In the Web Components Ecosystem there are multiple base and component libraries.
Depending on your requirements one might be more beneficial then the other.

If you want to build new component be sure to check out all [Base Libraries](./base-libraries.md).
If you want to use existing components then take a look at the [Component Libraries](./component-libraries.md).

Additionally there are multiple Web Component Communities. Most of them are around a specific Base or Component Library.
In any case join those which feel most appropriate to you.

Note: This is an incomplete list and if you know of other communities please let us know.
