Building is a necessary optimization when shipping apps to production. By using a build you reduce the total size and amount of files transferred to the end-user, and you ensure your code runs on all supported browsers.

We recommend doing most of the building only in projects which deploy the final result to production, such as apps or websites. This is where you can make the best decisions about supported browsers and optimizations.
