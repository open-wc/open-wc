# Automating

Having continuous integration in your project can provide valuable insights, and we consider it an essential in your projects.

## Circle ci
If you use the default generator you will already have CircleCi setup with a .circleci folder.
It also contains a config that takes care of linting and testing.

::: tip Info
This is part of the default [open-wc](https://open-wc.org/) recommendation.
:::

## Setup
```bash
npx -p yo -p generator-open-wc -c 'yo open-wc:tools-circleci'
```

### Manual Setup
- copy [.circleci/config.yml](https://github.com/open-wc/open-wc/blob/master/packages/generator-open-wc/generators/tools-circleci/templates/static/.circleci/config.yml) to  `.circleci/config.yml`

- Config is already present so you can simply click "Start building"

## Run Tests via Browserstack

- For open source projects you can request a sponsorhip (like we have for open-wc) => You only need to add the logo + link to browserstack and write an E-Mail.
- Go to [https://www.browserstack.com/accounts/settings](https://www.browserstack.com/accounts/settings)
- Look for "Automate", and write down the "Access Key" and "Username"
- Open your [circleci App](https://circleci.com/dashboard) or direclty via https://circleci.com/gh/{groupname}/{reponame}/edit
