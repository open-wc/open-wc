# Testing

Having tests should be the fundament of every production ready product.

## Bare Testing
We recommend using [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)(Behavior Driven Development) as it seem to be easier when talking to non tech collegues. However note that this can still be a personal preference - we give this recommendation to promote unity within everyone using this recommendation.

Using:
- System via [mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
- Assertions via [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)
- Mocks via [sinon](https://sinonjs.org/)

::: tip Info
This is part of the default recommendations

### Setup
```bash
npx -p yo -p generator-open-wc -c 'yo open-wc:testing-bare'
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
yarn add @open-wc/testing
```

Add to your test/index.js
```js
import '../bdd-setup.js';
```

### Usage
For now we still recommend using `polymer serve` in order to get bare module support.
- run `polymer serve`
- open browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8081/components/<component-name>/testing/`
