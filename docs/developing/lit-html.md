# lit-html

We recommend [lit-html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lit-html) with the [lit-element](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lit-element) base class as a general-purpose library for building web components. `lit-html` is feature complete, extremely lightweight and offers a great development experience.

Under the hood new Web Component APIs such as [Constructable Stylesheets](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/constructable-stylesheets) are used when they are available. As browser support improves, you get performance improvements for free.

## Getting started

To get started, we recommend using our project scaffolding:

```bash
npm init @open-wc
```

## Examples

Check out the [code examples](/developing/code-examples.html) page for a collection of best practices and design patterns.
