## [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and other Jetbrains variants

IntelliJ IDEA is a Java integrated development environment (IDE) for developing computer software. It is developed by JetBrains (formerly known as IntelliJ), and is available as an Apache 2 Licensed community edition and in a proprietary commercial edition.

Syntax highlighting from html and css in template literals should be supported out of the box. Generic web components related functionalitites such as Custom Elements support and completion is also available. You can read more about it [here](https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2013/10/phpstorm-7-web-toolkit-javascript-templates-web-components-support/).

Due to the support available directly in the IDE, the ecosystem for plugins is very limited and we do not recommend any.
