# Introduction

The goal of Open Web Components is to empower everyone with a powerful and battle-tested setup for sharing open source web components. We try to achieve this by giving a set of recommendations and defaults on how to facilitate your web component project. Our recommendations include: developing, linting, testing, tooling, demoing, publishing and automating.

## Quickstart

This will bootstrap a vanilla Web Component project based on our latest recommendations.

```bash
npm i -g yo
npm i -g generator-open-wc

# scaffold a complete new component
mkdir my-element
cd my-element
# Default development recommendation
yo open-wc:scaffold-vanilla

# upgrade/align your existing web component with 'open-wc' recommendations
cd existing-web-component
yo open-wc
```
