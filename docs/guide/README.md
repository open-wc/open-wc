# Introduction

The goal of Open Web Components is to empower everyone with a powerful and battle-tested setup for sharing open source web components. We try to achieve this by giving a set of recommendations and defaults on how to facilitate your web component project. Our recommendations include: developing, linting, testing, tooling, demoing, publishing and automating.

## Quickstart

This will bootstrap a vanilla Web Component project based on our latest recommendations.

```bash
# in a new or existing folder:
npm init yo open-wc
# requires npm 6 or higher
```
