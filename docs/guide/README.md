# Introduction

The goal of Open Web Components is to empower everyone with a powerful and battle-tested setup for sharing open source web components. We try to achieve this by giving a set of recommendations and defaults on how to facilitate your Web Component. Our recommendations include: developing, linting, testing, tooling, demoing, publishing and automating.

## Quickstart

This will bootstrap a vanilla Web Component project based on our latest recommendations.

```bash
mkdir my-element
cd my-element
# Default recommendation
npx -p yo -p generator-open-wc -c 'yo open-wc:vanilla'
```
