# Introduction

The goal of Open Web Components is to allow everyone to have a powerful setup for sharing open source web components. To achieve this we give a set of recommendations on how to facilitate such a component.

```bash
mkdir my-element
cd my-element
# Default recommendation
npx -p yo -p generator-open-wc -c 'yo open-wc:vanilla'
```
