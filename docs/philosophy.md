# Our philosophy

## Why open-wc

- The goal of Open Web Components is to empower everyone with a powerful and battle-tested setup for creating and sharing open source web components.
- Javascript fatigue: Enjoy the peace of mind that comes from having a well-known default solution for almost everything. Open-wc has got you covered.
- Making things accessible and approachable for people: Easy to use, ready to use, 'it just works' feeling

## Why webcomponents

- keep it frank, and friendly (no throwing shade at frameworks)
	- close to browser standards etc
	- bundle size?

## How we work

	- Polymer slack, evaluate tools, open discussion, blogs, ?????, etc.
