# Contact

The easiest is probably to create [a github issue](https://github.com/open-wc/open-wc/issues/new).
Don't be afraid to use it for questions as well.

Also we usually hang out on [polymer.slack.com in the #open-wc channel](https://polymer.slack.com/messages/CE6D9DN05) if you wanna chat.  
You can join polymers slack by visiting [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/polymer/shared_invite/enQtNTAzNzg3NjU4ODM4LTkzZGVlOGIxMmNiMjMzZDM1YzYyMzdiYTk0YjQyOWZhZTMwN2RlNjM5ZDFmZjMxZWRjMWViMDA1MjNiYWFhZWM).
